# Terms of Use 

*March 31, 2023*

Power Protocol (the "Protocol") is a decentralized governance framework that optimizes DAOs for making good decisions and building great products that maximize stakeholder value. It provides the mechanics for a network of highly effective and accountable DAOs to propagate and grow. This Website (https://app.power.tech/) and its features (the "Services") have a strictly non-commercial nature and function as an interface for the Protocol. The Power Protocol and its Website are governed by the PowerDAO.
By accessing the Website and using the Services, you agree to the binding rules of these Terms of Use (the "Terms"), which may be updated periodically. Users may be notified of such updates on the Website. New versions of the Terms will not apply retroactively. If you continue to use the website and the Services after a change, you are deemed to have accepted the new Terms. These Terms may be translated into other languages for the convenience of users. In the event of a conflict between the English version and any translations, the English version will prevail.
These Terms and the other material referenced in them are the entire agreement between you and the Protocol with respect to the Services.

## How the Protocol works
One of Power Protocol’s novel governance innovations is the KPI settlement transaction. The transactions are submitted on-chain by users for the community to vote and decide if an attempted KPI was complete or incomplete. As another key innovation, Power Protocol introduces user roles such as ‘Sentinels,’ for individuals willing to take direct responsibility for the positive or negative outcomes of tracking, completing and submitting KPIs for community approval.

If SP-DAO users disagree on whether a KPI has been completed or not, they may escalate a disputed vote to the Power DAO community for a resolution. If a KPI is completed, the Sentinel and SP-DAO community are rewarded with $POWER from either the SP-DAO’s profits or treasury. If a KPI is incomplete, the Sentinel and community are penalized by having a portion of their staked $POWER ‘slashed’ - its value effectively destroyed.

## Fees
We do not collect any fees but the Protocol’s payment partners might collect fees. The Protocol’s partners’ fees may vary slightly based on your location.
We will not collect any fees without giving you a chance to review and accept them. If the Protocol’s fees ever change, we’ll announce that on the Website. Each payment provider is its own company, and the Protocol isn’t responsible for its performance.
You’re responsible for paying any additional fees or taxes associated with your use of the Protocol.

## PowerDAO
Power DAO is Power Protocol’s genesis community and can generate an arbitrary number of Special Purpose DAOs (SP-DAOs) that use Power Protocol, it is an amorphic proto-DAO that functions as a town square, an incubator, an angel investor, and an arbitration layer for all communities that utilize the Power Protocol.
The Power DAO also functions as a last resort for settling disputed SP-DAO votes.

## Limitation of Liability
The Protocol is a technology platform that facilitates independent relationships between users offering ideas for proposals and users choosing to fund those ideas. As such, the Protocol cannot be held liable for any damages or losses related to your use of the Services, and does not get involved in disputes between users or between users and any third party related to the use of the Services. You assume all risks associated with accessing content through the Services and are solely responsible for any resulting damage or loss to any party.
The Power DAO team is developing the Website for free and does not profit from it.

If you decide to fund other users' ideas and proposals, you must conduct your own research. The Protocol does not provide any guarantees that the ideas you fund will be successful in the real world, and the Protocol does not verify the information provided by users and displays it on the Website as is.
Please note that if the Website stops working, you can still access your wallet address on the Waves Blockchain. However, the Protocol does not guarantee the success of any project and is not responsible for any losses the project may incur. To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will the Protocol, the Power DAO team, its directors, employees, partners, suppliers, or content providers be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, consequential, special, or exemplary damages of any kind, including but not limited to damages resulting from your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the Services, or for any conduct or content of any third party on the Website.
